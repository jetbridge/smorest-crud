# Flask CRUD
_Why repeat yourself?_

# What is this?
Right now, a work in progress.

This library aims to tie together Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Smorest to implement a sane default but easily customizable CRUD API based on SQLAlchemy models inside of Flask.

# Who is this for?
This library is only useful if your application uses:
* [Flask-Smorest](https://flask-smorest.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)
* [Flask-JWT-Extended](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)


# Where to look?
Look at `smorest_crud/test/app.py`

# Flask CRUD
_Why repeat yourself?_

# What is this?
Right now, a work in progress.


Discussion [over here](https://github.com/Nobatek/flask-rest-api/issues/79)


This library aims to tie together Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-REST-API to implement a sane default but easily customizable REST CRUD API based on SQLAlchemy models inside of Flask.

# Who is this for?
This library is only useful if your application uses:
* [Flask-REST-API](https://flask-rest-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)


# Where to look?
Look at `flask_crud/test/app.py`
